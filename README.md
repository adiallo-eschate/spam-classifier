Normalized the spam assassin dataset and used SVC with scikit-learn to train a spam classifier.

# Spam Classifier with Scikit-learn

This project builds a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam using Python and scikit-learn. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and performance metrics.

# Overview

- **Dataset**: Spam Assassin Dataset
- **Model**: Support Vector Machine
- **Vectorization**: CountVectorizer
- **Metrics**: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

# Files

- `spam_classifier.ipynb`: Main notebook with code and explanations
- `README.md`: Project documentation

# How to Run

1. Open the notebook in a local notebook or in the cloud ( like colaab)
2. Upload the dataset or use the link
3. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model

# Results

- **Accuracy**: 97%
- **Precision**: 96%
- **Recall**: 94%
- **F1-score**: 95%

# Tools Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
  
 Further Improvements

- Try other models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)
- Use word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Deploy with Flask or Streamlit
